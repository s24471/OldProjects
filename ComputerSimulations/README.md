## 📊 **List of Simulations**

### 🎢 [Inclined Ball Rolling Simulation](Ball/)  
A **physics-based ball simulation** rolling down an inclined plane, visualizing **energy conservation** and motion graphs.

### ⏳ [Pendulum Simulation](Pendulum/)  / [Chaotic Pendulum Simulation visualization](ChaoticPendulumn/)
A **damped pendulum** simulation using **Euler, Improved Euler, and Runge-Kutta methods**, with real-time energy tracking.  

### 🌿 [Fractal Plant Generator](Fractal/)  
A **recursive L-System simulation** generating **botanical fractals** using **Turtle Graphics** in Java.

### 🔲 [Cellular Automaton Simulator](GameofLife/)  
A **customizable cellular automaton** where users define survival and birth rules, similar to **Conway’s Game of Life**.

### 🔥 [Heat Conduction Simulation](Heatmap/)  
A **2D finite difference heat conduction model**, solving **Laplace’s equation** and displaying a **heatmap visualization**.
