# ðŸŒ¿ Fractal Plant Generator
This project generates L-System-based fractal plants using Java. The implementation follows a recursive growth pattern, simulating botanical structures.

# L-System Rules
Axiom: X (starting symbol)

Rule 1: X â†’ F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X

Rule 2: F â†’ FF

### Symbols:
- F â†’ Move forward
- \+ â†’ Turn left by ANGLE
- \- â†’ Turn right by ANGLE
- \[ â†’ Push current state (for branching)
- \] â†’ Pop saved state (return from branch)

# How It Works
Generates an L-System word based on the given rules and number of iterations.

Uses a Turtle Graphics system to interpret the word and draw the fractal.

Displays the generated plant in a Swing window.
